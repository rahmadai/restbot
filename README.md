## RestBot

### Usage
1. Clone repo
2. pip install -r requirements.txt

Modify the files in `data/` or the `domain.yml` file to play around.

### Training theÂ bot
#### Validating the data
Before training the bot, a good practice is to check for any inconsistencies in the stories and rules, though in a project this simple, it's unlikely to occur.
```
$ rasa data validate
```

#### Training
To train the bot, we simply use the rasa train command. We'll provide a name to the model for better organization, but it's not necessary.
```
$ rasa train --fixed-model-name RestoChatv2
```

#### Testing
To testing the bot, modify testing inside /tests folder
```
$ rasa test
```

### Chatting with the bot
To test your bot, open a new terminal window and start a rasa shell session.
```
$ rasa shell
```
This will let you chat with your bot in your terminal. If you want a more interactive UI and a little more debugging information like what intents were identified and what entities were extracted, you can use Rasa X.
